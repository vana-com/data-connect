# Doc creation conventions

## Filename

- Use `YYMMDD-*` prefix (e.g., `250115-pr-review-diff-injection.md`).

## Placement

- Use `/docs` at repo root for cross-repo or workflow/system docs.
- Use `apps/<app>/docs` for app-specific docs.
- Use `packages/<pkg>/docs` for package-specific docs.
- If it’s unclear, ask where it should live.
