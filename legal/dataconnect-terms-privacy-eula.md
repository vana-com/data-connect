## Software Terms, Privacy Notice, and End User License Agreement

**Last updated:** 6 February 2026

This document governs your access to and use of software and tools published by the **Vana Foundation** ("Vana," "we," "us"). It constitutes a combined **Privacy Notice, Terms of Use, and End User License Agreement (EULA)** for Foundation-published software, including **Data Connect** (the "Software").

By downloading, installing, or using the Software, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this document.

## 1. Role of the Vana Foundation

The Vana Foundation publishes open-source, user-operated software tools intended to support user-owned data and data portability.

The Foundation does not operate data extraction, scraping, or access to third-party systems as a service, and does not act as your agent, intermediary, or representative. Any actions taken using the Software are initiated, configured, and controlled by you.

## 2. Nature of the Software

The Software runs under your control on your local device and/or on execution environments you explicitly authorise. It is provided as software tooling, not as a hosted, managed, or supervised service, and may be open source and capable of being modified, forked, or deployed independently of the Foundation.

The Software is designed as a **general-purpose utility tool** that can be used in a variety of user-directed workflows. Any data extraction functionality is incidental to the Software's role as a user-controlled utility and does not constitute a standalone service, managed offering, or data acquisition operation by the Foundation.

The Foundation does not monitor, direct, or supervise how you use the Software or the targets you select.

## 3. Privacy and Data Processing

The Vana Foundation does not receive, store, or process your third-party platform credentials, does not receive, store, or process data you extract from third-party platforms using the Software, and does not access the contents of any data acquired through your use of the Software. Data acquisition, where it occurs, takes place in environments controlled or authorised by you, and outside Foundation-controlled infrastructure.

The Foundation may process limited information strictly necessary to distribute, maintain, and support the Software, such as basic download or update metadata, non-sensitive performance or error telemetry (where enabled), and governance or protocol-interaction data. This processing does not include extracted third-party content and does not involve determining the purposes or means of any data acquisition performed by you.

Where any information processed by the Foundation is deemed to constitute personal data under applicable data protection laws, such processing occurs solely at your request or direction, is limited to what is technically necessary to provide and support the Software, and is based on your explicit and informed consent where required. The Foundation does not independently determine the purposes or means of such processing.

You determine whether and how to access or acquire data using the Software, and you determine the purposes for which any such data is processed. To the extent applicable, you act as the data controller in respect of any personal data you acquire or process using the Software, and the Foundation acts only in a limited, technical capacity consistent with your instructions.

## 4. User Responsibility and Representations

You are solely responsible for your use of the Software.

By using the Software, you represent and warrant that you have the legal right to access any systems or data you target, that you are authorised to use any credentials you supply, and that your use of the Software complies with applicable laws and third-party platform terms.

You acknowledge that, where you provide personal data through your use of the Software, you do so voluntarily and at your direction.

## 5. No Authorisation, Endorsement, or Legal Advice

Nothing in the Software or this document authorises access to third-party systems, endorses or approves specific extraction targets, or constitutes legal advice regarding data access, scraping, or compliance.

References to data ownership or data portability are descriptive and informational only.

## 6. Open Source and "As Is" Provision

The Software is provided as **open-source, user-operated utility software**, on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind, including warranties of legality, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or compliance with third-party platform rules.

Open-source components are governed by their respective licenses, which are made available in the relevant code repositories.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Vana Foundation shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, including loss of data, loss of access, or enforcement actions by third parties, arising out of or relating to your use of the Software.

## 8. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Vana Foundation from any claims, losses, liabilities, or expenses arising from your use of the Software, your access to or extraction of data, or your violation of applicable law or third-party platform terms.

## 9. Termination

The Foundation may suspend or terminate access to the Software where required by law or to mitigate legal or security risk. Termination does not affect your responsibility for prior use.

## 10. Governing Law and Venue

This document is governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles. The courts of the Cayman Islands shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of or relating to this document or the Software.

## 11. Relationship to Other Disclosures

Additional disclosures may be presented at specific points in the user experience, including when initiating data extraction or authorising execution on decentralised protocol infrastructure. Those disclosures supplement this document.

Your acceptance of this document constitutes your acknowledgment and, where applicable, your explicit consent to the processing arrangements described herein.

## 12. Acceptance

By downloading, installing, or using the Software, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this document.
